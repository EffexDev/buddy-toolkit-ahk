# BuddyToolBoard

This is an AHK V2 based Gui that stores and generates all the required templates for tasking and responding to emails, as well as a few useful tools for network troubleshooting

Aside from the visible controls there are only a couple of hotkey based scripts:

Double @ for sending our work email addresses
Ctrl+Shift+S for generating a randomised email signature from a hardcoded list.

Please Enjoy
