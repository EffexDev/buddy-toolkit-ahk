    "Wifi Limitations", "Hey xxx,`n`nWiFi speeds are unfortunately not a good indicator of achievable service speeds.`n`nIt is possible to improve the speeds by adjusting the frequency and channels of the WiFi, which we can provide instructions for, however the automatic mode on most routers is sufficient. What is more likely to help is assessing environmental factors such as distance, line of sight and interference.`n`nTo limit interference please ensure that the router is connected to power on its own socket, not in a power board, and avoid placing it near large white good appliances or microwaves. Metal objects do block WiFi signals so avoid having large metal objects between your router and connected devices.`n`nRegards,`nxxx",

    "Bandsteering", "Hey xxx,`n`nMost modern routers have two WiFi bands, 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz. The 2.4 band has higher range but a lower total throughput, and the 5 band has lower range but higher throughput. If you only see one wifi channel from your router, it means that a setting called band steering is combining the band for you, and negotiating which devices connect to which channel.`n`nFor most scenarios this is ideal, however band steering can sometimes default your devices to the 2.4Ghz band, causing lower than expected speeds.`n`nIn these instances we can walk you through disabling the band steering option on your router if it is available.`n`nRegards,`nxxx",

In the case of high speed services the minimum specifications are:`n1000/50 plan then the minimum speed is 501/25.`n250/25 plan then the minimum speed is 126/12.`n`nTo determine this we will need you to run direct connection tests from a laptop or PC directly to the NBN device, as NBN will not accept tests done over Wi-Fi or ethernet to the router.`n`nDirect connection speed test instructions:`n1. Kick your connection using the service tests in the Buddy Telco App`n2. Unplug your Modem/Router from the NBN device`n3. Using the same cable from the NBN device, plug in a laptop or computer.`n4.

    "Stability Profile", "Apply: Hey  xxx,`n`nIn order for us to raise this as a dropouts fault with NBN, we need to apply a stability profile and monitor the connection for 48 hours.

Please let us know when it would be an appropriate time for us to apply this, as it will cause the router to lose connection momentarily. `n`nRegards,`nxxx`n`n------------------------------`n`nRemove: Hey xxx,`n`nAs the testing now shows no dropouts we could now look at removing the stability profile on your service to return your speeds back to normal. When we do this, you will initially experience a dropout whilst your modem re-syncs. `n`nRegards,`nxxx",

    "SRA", "Hey xxx,`n`nSRA and SOS/ROC are protocols that ensure the router remains connected at the correct frequency. When the router first syncs wit DSL/RJ11 cable. (This is ah the NBN line it syncs at the current line rate. SRA and SOS/ROC allow it to change to different line rates when the frequency on the incoming copper changes. If SRA and SOS/ROC are not showing on the NBN testing or are not available settings on the router this can cause dropouts and speed fluctuations. If the settings are not available in the router, it may need a firmware upgrade, or the router may not be compatible.`n`nRegards,`nxxx",

    "Cabling", "Hey xxx,`n`nDue to the number of external factors that can affect WiFi signals, we are unable to isolate dropouts faults using WiFi troubleshooting.`nAre you able to connect a device such as a laptop or PC to the router using an ethernet cable and test to see if the dropouts still occur?`n`nAnother good way to tell the difference is if your mobile phone will switch back to mobile data when the dropout occurs.
