Buddy Telco Toolkit Changelog
Author: Jordan Cartledge

------ Version 1.0 ------

I lost track of this somewhat and did not keep a changelog.
This first release verion has all of the templates that we made during pre-launch and the first 3 months of Buddy.
The tools included are the content-aware search, Startup of all programs, terminal lock, Ping test, Traceroute, NSLookup and pro-rata calc.

From here all changes will be detailed.
