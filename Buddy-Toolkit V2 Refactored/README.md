# Buddy Toolkit

This is an AHK V2 based Gui that stores and generates all the required templates for tasking and responding to emails, as well as a few useful tools for network troubleshooting

Aside from the visible controls there are only a couple of hotkey based scripts:

Double @ for sending our work email addresses

Ctrl+Shift+S for generating a randomised email signature from a hardcoded list.

Shift + Click to drag the window

Alt+F1 to reload the script

Please Enjoy
